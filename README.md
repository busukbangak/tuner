# Tuner

This is a generic tuner app that can tune guitars, ukuleles, and other instruments. It works well for most notes, but may have problems detecting lower-pitched notes or very quiet notes.

## Features
- Can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your mobile phone for easy access.
- UI generated by ChatGPT, inspired by Ableton Live's tuner.
- Components generated via v0.

## Tuning Logic
The tuning logic was implemented with help from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qAFnFQRRg).
